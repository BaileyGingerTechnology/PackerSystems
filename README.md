# PackerSystems

The goal of this project is to eventually provide practice environments for things such as:

1. CyberPatriot for high school students
2. CCDC for college students
3. And an example of a small environment that one might find in the real world

Long term goals for the first two are to have a basic scoring engine that will give points as the player fixes bad practices and implements good ones
and I hope to be able to keep the example of a real environment up to date.

## Progress so far:

### CyberPatriot:

So far I have the Ubuntu image functional. It is going to act as a web server, though I don't have plans for it other than that.
