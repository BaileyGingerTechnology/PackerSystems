# GentooInstall
A set of scripts to automate the Gentoo install process.

## Usage

### On Gentoo/Gentoo Live CD

This is the system it works best on. To use:

git clone https://github.com/BaileyGingerTechnology/GentooInstall.git

cd GentooInstall

sudo ./main.sh

And then follow the instructions the script will print as it goes. At the moment that should only be:

Pick the tarball to use, run step_two.sh in a new terminal, return to the original terminal, cd GentooInstall again, and then run step_three.sh

### On other OSes/Live CDs

The system will theorectically work the same, but I cannot guarantee anything. The scripts will have to install a few extra tools, so it will take longer.

git clone https://github.com/BaileyGingerTechnology/GentooInstall.git

cd GentooInstall

sudo ./main.sh

And then follow the instructions the script will print as it goes. At the moment that should only be:

Pick the tarball to use, run step_two.sh in a new terminal, return to the original terminal, cd GentooInstall again, and then run step_three.sh
